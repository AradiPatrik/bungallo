## Bungallo

This project is my solution for the second code assignment for the epam java webapp developer bootcamp.
The biggest challange with this exercise, was that I wanted to make the frontend as responsive as possible.
I tested the website with Edge, Firefox, Chrome on desktop, and with Chrome and Firefox on mobile.
